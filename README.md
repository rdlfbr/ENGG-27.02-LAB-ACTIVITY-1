# ENGG-27.02-LAB-ACTIVITY-1

### Current Status
#1 : 60%
- a is wrong 
- b code is written but incomplete without a, currently broken doe
- c is done. i think theres a mistake tho because the intial values of charge and current should be 1 and 0 respectively

#2 : 95%
- a and b are done. i'm not sure about my true/approx errors

#3 : 95%
- done and correct but im not sure about the stopping criterion
- i realize that i didnt graph the cosine function correctly since its supposed to oscilate oops. baka tanggalin ko nalang graph kung tinatamad ako
